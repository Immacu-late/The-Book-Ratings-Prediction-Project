## The Book Ratings Prediction Project

Two Jupyter notebooks can be found in the repository;
1. Book Ratings Prediction EDA and
2. Book Ratings Prediction ML Model Fitting.

The purpose of these notebooks are according to their names. The first is for an exploratory analysis on the Goodreads dataset, while the second is about feature engineering, model fitting, and model selection.

To set up an environment where these notebooks can run, I've included a requirements.txt file that contains all the packages that need to be installed.

In a python environment, just do;
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

This would install all dependencies for the notebook to run.

Once the dependencies have been installed, Open each notebook and re-run the code in each cell to have all the outputs reproduced.
